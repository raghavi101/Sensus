# Sensus
A real time dashboard that lets traders know the sentiment of the street (Bombay Stock Exchange). The market index scales from 0 to 100 with key values being 30 and 70. Signals can be generated by looking for divergences and failure swings. Various feeds on the dashboard work in synchronization with the sensex index value. Triggers are set off that signal the trader that the market might be greedy or fearful with each shift in the index value throughout the day.
